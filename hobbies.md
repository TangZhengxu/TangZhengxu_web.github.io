<br>Part of my collections. I love to build my own keyboard. Building something new from scratch always gives me a sense of accomplishment. I have recently been teaching myself some knowledge about embedded, hoping to truly design my own keyboard from scratch.




## Making model

<br>I'm an avid enthusiast of Gundam and Patlabor. The process of assembling and painting the models brings me immense satisfaction, as I see the robots from the animations materialize before me.


## Riding

<br> The bike serves as more than merely a tool for my daily commute. Every weekend, I relish the opportunity to embark on brief excursions to the suburbs by bike. It's there that the crisp air and stunning vistas provide a deep sense of relaxation.
