<img src="/images/WechatIMG1166.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">


Hi! My name is **Zhengxu Tang (唐正旭)**.

I am currently a senior at the University of Michigan, pursuing a double major in **Mathematical Sciences - Operations Research and Modeling** and **Computer Science**. At present, I'm engaged as a research assistant in the **Bio-Medical AI Lab**, under the guidance of [Dr. Liyue Shen](https://liyueshen.engin.umich.edu/). Previously, I worked in the **Li Lab**, mentored by [Dr. Jinxing Li](https://www.labli.net/).

My research interests lie in the brain-computer interface, electrophysiological sensing, and bio-electronic research.

Should you share similar interests or consider potential collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me at **tangzx@umich.edu**. I'd love to engage in discussions and explore opportunities for collaboration.

## Research Interests

- AI for Bio-Medical
- Multimodal representation learning
- AI for Brain-Computer Interface

My current research focuses on building a foundational multimodal model based on multiple types of medical data, such as medical images, genomics data, EHRs, and so on. I am particularly interested in Multimodal Learning and its applications in the Biomedical field. Human process various modes of information—including sight, sound, smell, and touch—constantly, and this information shapes our cognition and understanding of the world. Everything is interconnected. For this reason, I firmly believe that multimodal deep learning models are the most effective tools for addressing biomedical problems. I am committed to devoting my skills and expertise to this meaningful endeavor, with the aim of contributing to societal well-being.
